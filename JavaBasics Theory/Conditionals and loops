Conditionals and Loops:
    We have different types of functions for loops and conditions-

Conditionals:
    1- If-else

        if(Expression is true)
        {
            Execute these statements;
        }
        else
        {
            Execute these statements;
        }

    Variation- if if you just wan tto check condition and exit if not true

        if(Expression)
        {
            Statements;
        }

    Variation - If-else if-else (For checking more than one condition)

        if(Expression is true)
        {
            Execute these statements;
        }
        else if(Another expression or condition is true)
        {
            Execute these statements;
        }
        ...  // keep adding else if blocks for more conditions and finally end with else block
        else
        {
            Statements;
        }


    2- Switch Case

        If condition is for checking a constant we can use switch instead of for

        Switch(Expression) {
            case a:
                Statements;
                break;
            case b:
                Statements;
                break;
            default:
                Statements;
        }

        -Duplicate cases not allowed
        -cases have to be same type as expression, should be constant or literal
        -break is there to terminate sequences else it will continue in to the next case
        -default is usually put at end and specifies what to execute if none of the cases are fullfilled

        Enhanced switch case

            Switch(Expression){
                case a -> statement;
                case b -> statement;
                default -> statement;
            }

            No need for break, its being used in the background by java

Loops:
    used to execute codes that need to be executed multiple times based on some condition

    1- For loop

        for(initialisation ; condition ; increment/decrement)
        {
            Statements;
        }

        Here the statements inside for will be executed till the condition in for has been met.

        Variation- Enhanced for(For each loop)

         for(datatype Item : array)
         {
            Statements;
         }

         Ex-

         int[] numbers = {3, 9, 5, -5};
         // for each loop
         for (int number: numbers) {
           System.out.println(number);
         }

    2- While and Do-While

       While(Expression)
       {
            Statements;
       }

       Do
       {
            Statements;
       }While(Expression)


      -While block will only execute if condition is true, do while will execute atleast once regardless of the condition and then check if its true
