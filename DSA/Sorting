Sorting
    -Sorting a given unsorted array in a specific order(asc or desc)
    -There are many sorting methods to use based on the requirement and time complexities.

Bubble Sort
    -Its a comparision type sorting method
    -Also known as sinking sort or exchange sort
    -we compare each element with the next element, if the arr[i]>arr[i+1] we swap the elements

    Code:
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j<arr.length-i;j++)
             {
                if(arr[j]<arr[j-1])
                    swap value
             }
             break the loop if no swaps performed.
        }

    Complexity
        Space complexity -
            O(1)- no extra space is needed since we are not copying the array, also known as in place sorting algorithms
        Time complexity
            best case- O(N)- if the array is sorted - so the loop will run atleast once and perform N-1 swaps but we ignore the contants so it O(N).
            worst case-O(N^2)-if the array is sorted in reverse order
