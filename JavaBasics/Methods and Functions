Methods:

    Block of code that is performing some operation which is not present in main, or code that is getting repeated
    Syntax:
        access_modifier return_type method_name(Arguments)
        {
            Code;
            return statement;
        }

    Ex:
        private int sum(int a, int b)
        {
            int sum=a+b;
            return sum;

        }
    -Java only has pass by value, no concept of pass by reference here,copy of the actual value is passed so both the references(passed var and function var)
     will point to the same value.
    -For primitive datatypes it will only pass the value, for objects and references and complex datatypes  it will pass the value of the reference variable.
    -Scope of variables
        -Any variable defined in the block is available throughout the block, but not outside it
        -if variable defined inside function it will be visible to any blocks present inside the function
        -for loop also has its own scope for the var initialised in the for loop

    Shadowing:
       -if Variable is a class variable(defined inside class but outside any function) it will be available to all the functions inside the class.
       -till a local variable of the same name is defined in any function,in which case the function will use the local variable
       -and the class variable will become hidden for the function to any code written after the declaration of the local variable.
